# Claude session journal (Symphony)

Claude-facing. Dated session wrap-ups, narrative, self-corrections, and
verification detail go here — NOT in `maintenance/log.md`, which is the
human ship's log and gets only 1-3 factual lines per finished piece of work.
Append at the bottom, newest last.

The pre-trim session narrative that used to live in `maintenance/log.md`
(the long 2026-08-11 … 2026-08-19 entries) is preserved in git history at
commit e176d2b; read it there rather than re-deriving.

## 2026-08-19 — doc-bloat audit and slop segregation

- Audited maintenance/ and reference/ for AI slop and audience drift;
  report with per-item verdicts in `intermediate_files/doc-bloat-audit.md`.
- Mark's ruling: maintenance/log.md and priorities.md are human files —
  Claude writes there only when meaningful high-level work is DONE, 1-3
  lines. All session state, micro-tasks and narrative live under
  `intermediate_files/claude_slop/` (this directory). He explicitly rejected
  putting Claude scratch in maintenance/ or reference/, and rejected the
  dotfiles `boards/` location for symphony content.
- Done this session: created claude_slop/{kanban,log}.md; moved the SignalK
  detailed backlog + Blocked section from priorities.md into kanban.md;
  trimmed maintenance/log.md's 08-11…08-19 entries to short factual bullets;
  rewrote CLAUDE.md's log.md/priorities.md sections and added the
  claude_slop rules + captain-credentials freeze; descoped dotfiles
  boards/claude.md to dotfiles-only and removed boards/human.md (symphony
  content stays in symphony).
- Remaining work is listed in kanban.md § Doc-cleanup follow-ups.
